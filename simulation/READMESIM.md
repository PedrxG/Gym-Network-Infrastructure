# ðŸ§© GymLink Network Simulation (.pkt)

This file contains the **executable Cisco Packet Tracer simulation** for the GymLink Network Infrastructure project.

It provides a complete, interactive model of the LAN topology, enabling hands-on verification of all implemented security and connectivity configurations described in this repository.

### **Key Features for Verification**
- **Physical Topology:** Includes the router, switches, Access Point (AP), servers, and client PCs forming the full GymLink LAN.
- **Logical Segmentation:** Five VLANs (`10`â€“`50`) configured with Router-on-a-Stick inter-VLAN routing.
- **Security Policies:** Implementation of all ACLs and DHCP configurations defined in the corresponding `.txt` configuration files.
- **Functional Testing:** Supports connectivity verification (Ping tests) and the external Attacking Test to validate the routerâ€™s simulated firewall.

### **Prerequisite**
- Requires **Cisco Packet Tracer** to open, view, and interact with the simulation file.
